  text: () => 'An ordinary new OpenPencil design is one strict transaction: `openpencil_pipeline_begin` -> batch 1 -> batch 2 -> `openpencil_pipeline_finish`. Only when the user explicitly asks for the high-fidelity App-identical engine, begin may take engine:"app-agent": then the transaction is begin -> one `openpencil_pipeline_agent_run` -> finish, with no generation batches. Call begin exactly once and immediately; never load `openpencil-design` first. Omit begin.path unless the user explicitly named a file: the plugin chooses the concrete collision-resistant `.op` filename. Preserve an explicitly named path exactly. Pass the user\'s direct request as begin.brief without adding a platform, viewport, or device they did not name. Begin fixes the path, root, platform, and canvas for the whole transaction: default to web/desktop unless the user explicitly requested mobile, then never reinterpret, switch, or rebuild them. After every successful begin/batch call, make the next required call without narration, planning, comparison, inspection, or any unrelated tool call. A thrown error or any result with `canContinue:false` is terminal: report it once and do not retry, inspect, context-read, abort, or start a replacement draft. In run_code use exactly:\n'
    + 'const draftId = "<exact begin.draftId>";\n'
    + 'const script = String.raw`...`;\n'
    + 'const r = await tools.openpencil_pipeline_batch({ draftId, script });\n'
    + 'return r;\n'
    + 'Quote the exact begin.draftId into the standalone `draftId` string first. The fixed call object contains only `draftId` and `script`; return only `r`. Batch 1 and batch 2 are fresh-scope direct I/K scripts against begin.rootNodeId. I/K return opaque node-id strings: use a returned binding only as a later I/K parent, put every property in the node object passed to I/K, and never assign `binding.x`, `binding.y`, or any other member. '
    + 'A category rail gives every distinct label a distinct matching icon tile named `<label> icon tile`; never name category tiles art/media/image or give them image queries. Match 数码/electronics to `smartphone` or `camera`, and 食品/food to `utensils`, `sandwich`, or `croissant`; never use `lamp` or `coffee` for those categories. Every `iconFontName` must come from the verified glyph list in begin\'s `buildContract.node.icon`; an off-catalog name renders as an invisible blank. Complete each repeated product card\'s media (or intentionally omit it), name, and price before starting the next card. Batch 2 always ends by attaching the required Footer as the last root region: a role footer `#1C1917` full-width band (padding `[48,160]` desktop, `[40,24]` mobile) holding the brand text in `#FFFFFF`, one role nav-links row of minWidth-44 height-44 role nav-link frames with `#D6D3D1` labels, and a 13px `#A8A29E` copyright line — a page without its Footer is unfinished. Bind every semantic container (Header, Nav, Actions, section, card, Footer) to a const and insert its children through that binding, never as root siblings; an empty role container fails the batch. '
    + 'Every generated text node explicitly uses `fontFamily:"Inter, system-ui, sans-serif"`: desktop keeps its bundled Inter while the web editor has a portable generic fallback and never depends on a locally installed Inter face. Visible copy follows the user request language consistently; a Chinese request means Chinese copy except an optional short ASCII brand. The begin result already selects the concrete style guide; use its palette, typography, spacing, and recipe without another context/tool call. In generation scripts use literal hex colors directly in node objects, not palette alias variables. Default to one image outside commerce. For desktop commerce, batch 1 uses the bundled ecommerce-modern-light direction: clean white base, warm-tinted section rhythm, 1120px centered content, 56px Hero display, and a balanced horizontal two-column split row inside an optional warm section wrapper. Header role navbar, height 64, `padding:[0,160]`; Nav role nav-links contains 44px role nav-link frames, each containing its text child; never put nav-link on text. Header actions role toolbar contains 44x44 role icon-button frames. CTA role button is 160x48 with #C2410C/#FFFFFF and its label inside the CTA binding. Hero is full-width with `padding:[64,160]`, copy width 512 + gap 64 + image width 448; headline and subtitle each use `width:"fill_container"`. Generic commerce creates the product image directly under Hero: `I(hero,{type:"image",name:"Hero product image",width:448,height:360,imageSearchQuery:"gray loveseat isolated photo"})`; `imageSearchQuery` is a direct field, never `image:{...}`, never a wrapper, never mixed with shapes, and never reused by a product card. Use a 4-6 layer layout:none ellipse/path composition only when the user explicitly requests illustration/no photos. '
    + 'Desktop commerce uses exactly three equal-width fill_container product cards from one coherent collection spanning the rail, with 24px gaps and no unused right tail; a mobile product rail instead uses at most 2 fill_container cards or equal numeric-width cards inside an explicit clipped scroller — never three fill_container cards. Badge text on the #C2410C accent must be >=15px semibold, or use #C2410C text on #FFF7ED. A generic home collection uses the exact validated queries `gray armchair isolated photo`, `artemide tolomeo lamp photo`, and `potted plant isolated photo`; the third card is a potted plant, not a vase. That trio is only for a generic home brief — in any other vertical every card query must name the exact product in that card visible name (咖啡 => `latte cup photo`), never the home trio. Every commerce `imageSearchQuery` uses no more than four English words, names exactly one product, and never uses a broad lifestyle, collection, or category query. Never put a lone small icon inside large fixed product media. Each Hero/Product/Art/Media frame has exactly one primary visual: one image leaf with a concrete English `imageSearchQuery`, or one substantial composed-shape visual, never an image plus an icon placeholder. The host enriches committed commerce images before each live preview, while finish retains one canonical post-final fallback. '
    + 'After batch 2, call finish once. `published:true` is terminal success. A result with `canContinue:true` continues by doing exactly what its `next` says: `stage:"needs_preview"` or `stage:"needs_refinalization"` means call finish exactly once more (never inspect or rerun generation); `stage:"needs_visual_review"` presents the final preview digest plus a checklist — either call finish once more unchanged to accept and publish, or send exactly ONE bounded correction batch (I/K/U only, at most 16 calls and 6 KiB, never rebuilding Header or Hero) and then finish; and `stage:"needs_correction"` requires `canContinue:true` and one complete non-empty `repairTargets` array whose `checks.dsh.repairTargetSummary.omitted` is `0` and whose every item contains `operation:"U"`, an exact non-empty `nodeId`, and a non-empty `patch`: apply every item together in exactly one U-only batch, then call finish exactly once more, with no narration between them. The host bounds repair rounds at two: repair again ONLY when the new finish result itself presents another complete repairTargets array. Any other non-published finish result is terminal; stop on anything except `published:true` and never retry, inspect, read an image/context, abort, or rebuild.',
